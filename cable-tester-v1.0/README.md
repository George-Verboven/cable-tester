There are many things I would change/fix/optimize, but this works for now. I will revisit this in the near future to correct design oversights.

Please note this leaves pins necessary for Adafruit Joystick TFt use exposed. You may need to reroute the SPI pins and shift pins 13-9 by using pin extenders, but it is possible to retain SPI and I2C functionality.
